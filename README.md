# AWS Serverless CI/CD Pipeline Starter Template
---

This template is meant as a starting guide for building a Serverless CI/CD Pipeline for AWS SAM Applications.

_Note: This is easily adaptable in many ways to other applications. This project assumes you are using AWS SAM for application development, and Github as the source repository._

## Prerequisites
---
- [Installing AWS CLI ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [Configuring AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
- [Generage GitHub OAuth Token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/GitHub-create-personal-token-CLI.html)


## Configuring Parameters
---
Replace the `--value "XXXX"` with your information, and run each of the following commands in your terminal to generate parameters in AWS Parameter Store, which will be used to populate Stack runtime values.

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/sns/serverless-pipeline/notifications/primary-email" \
    --description "Email address for primary recipient of Pipeline notifications" \
    --type "String" \
    --value "PRIMARY_EMAIL_ADDRESS"

aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/codepipeline/serverless-pipeline/github/repo" \
    --description "Github Repository name for CloudFormation Stack serverless-pipeline" \
    --type "String" \
    --value "GITHUB_REPO_NAME"

aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/codepipeline/serverless-pipeline/github/token" \
    --description "Github Token for CloudFormation Stack serverless-pipeline" \
    --type "String" \
    --value "TOKEN"

aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/codepipeline/serverless-pipeline/github/user" \
    --description "Github Username for CloudFormation Stack serverless-pipeline" \
    --type "String" \
    --value "GITHUB_USER"
```

## Provisioning
---
Update the `tags.json` file and populate with any necessary tags for the stack.

```json
[
    {
        "Key": "created_by",
        "Value": "scott schmidt"
    }
]
```

Run the following AWS CLI command to create a pipeline for your SAM Serverless App:

```bash
aws cloudFormation create-stack \
    --stack-name serverless-pipeline \
    --template-body file://pipeline.yaml \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
    --tags file://tags.json
```

This may take a couple of minutes to complete, therefore give it a minute or two and then run the following command to retrieve the Git repository:

```bash
aws cloudFormation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name serverless-pipeline \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```

## Software Release Process
---
Follow standard Git workflow to deploy code to a Master branch on GitHub. This can be accomplished by pushing directly to Master, _if you like living dangerously_, or through a Pull Request approval/merge on GitHub.

```bash
â˜  sam-starter-template âž¤ 309674a|masterðŸ’¥
âžœ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   template.yaml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
â˜  sam-starter-template âž¤ 309674a|masterðŸ’¥
âžœ git add .
â˜  sam-starter-template âž¤ 309674a|masterðŸ’¥
âžœ git commit -m 'adds new feature...'
[master 105ba46] adds new feature...
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

   309674a..105ba46  master -> master
â˜  sam-starter-template âž¤ 105ba46|masterðŸ’£
âžœ
```
The pipeline will now use a webhook with GitHub to pull your source code release and promote it through the pipeline.
